"""One-click 「填入」: put a candidate reply into WeChat's input box.

Goutoujunshi's vendored copy supports the AX path only. The upstream visual
keyboard fallback has been removed. If WeChat exposes no verifiable input
control, the caller offers manual copy instead.

Preferred mechanism — the Accessibility API:
    find WeChat's input box in the accessibility tree (the AXTextArea inside the window
    titled 微信), write the text into it, then read it back and only report success if the
    text is verifiably there.

Why not the obvious pasteboard + synthesized Cmd+V, which is what this file used to do:
  * a paste only reaches the *frontmost* app, so WeChat has to be brought forward first —
    and a non-active accessory app cannot reliably do that on current macOS (measured:
    NSRunningApplication activation and AXFrontmost both report success while the app stays
    inactive). When that step fails, the keystroke lands in whatever app IS frontmost, i.e.
    the reply gets typed into someone else's window;
  * it overwrites the general pasteboard, destroying whatever the user had copied;
  * "the events were posted" is not "the text arrived", so the result could not be checked
    — the panel would claim 已填入 over an input box that was still empty, and the user,
    seeing nothing, would click again.
The accessibility write avoids all three: it needs no frontmost window, never touches the
clipboard, and can be read back to prove it worked.

macOS only lets a process touch another app's accessibility tree when that process holds
the Accessibility permission (System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility).
Without it the AX calls fail, which is why fill_text() checks first and returns
(False, "未授予辅助功能权限") rather than pretending it worked. request_accessibility()
triggers the system dialog that grants it.

Standalone use (handy for granting the permission before the HUD ever needs it):
    uv run python src/fill.py             # report permission + WeChat process state only
    uv run python src/fill.py "好的，马上"  # actually fill (needs the grant)
